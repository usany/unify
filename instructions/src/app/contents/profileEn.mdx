# Profile <a id="profile" />

This page allows you to view user profiles.
On your own profile page, you can upload a profile image and change your name and campus. If you are on campus, you can perform a campus location check, which resets daily. A user's campus location status is visible on the user search page.
Password changes and account deletion are also available from your profile.
Points, followers, and following counts can be clicked to view detailed information.
A graph of the user's sharing frequency and their shared cards are displayed. You can swipe through cards one by one. You can also filter to see only "Borrowing" or "Lending" cards.
From another user's profile, you can follow them or navigate to a chat page with them.
If you wish to report another user, you can click "Report" to go to the reporting page.
