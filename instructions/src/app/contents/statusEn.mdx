# Status <a id="status" />

This page allows you to check ongoing cards and conversations.
Clicking on a card reveals the details on its front and back. The front shows the user initiating the share along with the item, location, and time. You can proceed from start to finish of a share by clicking buttons on the front of the card. The back displays a history of each step in the process. When a user needs to check details to proceed with a share, a light effect appears around the card. During an ongoing share, you can click the other person's profile to go to their profile page. When a share is not in progress, you can long-press the card or delete it from the details view.
Clicking on a conversation takes you to the chat page. You can set notifications in group chat rooms to include those conversations. If you want to delete a conversation from your status, you can long-press it to delete.
